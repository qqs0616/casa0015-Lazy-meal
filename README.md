# Lazy meal - Search recipes to build a meal plan

The application allows users to search for desired recipes based on the cuisine, ingredients and area, as well as sorting recipes by popularity and newest. The selected recipes can be added to a meal plan or the required ingredients can be added directly to the ingredients list. Selected recipes can be viewed by switching pages via the navigation bar and the user can manage what is added on the ingredients page and the plan page.

## Features 
Search page: Users can enter content in the search box above and select criteria to search and sort recipes.
The crying face emoji at the top means that the meal plan has not been added today and will change to a smiley face when added.
